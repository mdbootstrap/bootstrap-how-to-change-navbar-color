# How to change Bootstrap Navbar color?

Theming the navbar has never been easier thanks to the combination of theming classes and `background-color` utilities. Choose from `.navbar-light` for use with light background colors, or `.navbar-dark` for dark background colors. Then, customize with `.bg-*` utilities.

See also our [color docs](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/content-styles/colors/) to learn more about colors.

**Dark backgrounds examples (with the usage of `.navbar-dark`)**

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-dark">
  <!-- Navbar content -->
</nav>

<nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-primary">
  <!-- Navbar content -->
</nav>
```
